I grew up with adventurous parents who raised me in countries across Europe, Asia, South America, and Polynesia. After turning 18 I made way to Sao Paulo, Brazil where I became an entrepreneur providing language learning services to corporate clients using the immersive techniques I used to learn languages while growing up abroad. Thereafter, I made my way back to the U.S. and worked in Portuguese and French translation and volunteered for refugee resettlement."
